*** Fully Finish Thesis by March 26th ***


To Do:
    -Continious note playing
    - Add option to switch the keys
    - Add all necessary wav files
    - slow down processes to make more efficient
    - Adjust it to just one electrode
    - Make the space bar the play Note
    - Adjust calibration procedure
    - Make tables for Plots
    - Plots:
        - Accuracy vs Power Band
        - Accuracy of All Electodes vs. Single Electrode
        - General Accuracy for Best Band(s)
        - Accuracy by Note
        - Chord Accuracy
        - Accuracy vs. Training Time
    - Quantitative Results:
        - Latency
        - Runtime
    - Testing procedure
    
    Optional: 
    - Make a C–G–Am–F Chord Progression option
    
    
Meeting 3/9:
    - Discussion Points:
        - Progress:
            - Classifiers for Single, Double, Triple, and One Electrode Completed
            - Debugged
            - Select keys
            - Chord Option
        - Previous experiment's testing procedure (use or no)
        - Hackathon
        - Ask ethan for access to tutorial
        
Send hackathon to QMind saying the lab is open
